Longest Common Subsequence of Two Sequences

Problem Introduction
Compute the length of a longest common subsequence of two sequences.

Problem Description
Task. Given two sequences 𝐴 = (𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) and 𝐵 = (𝑏1, 𝑏2, . . . , 𝑏𝑚), find the length of their longest
common subsequence, i.e., the largest non-negative integer 𝑝 such that there exist indices 1 ≤ 𝑖1 <
𝑖2 < · · · < 𝑖𝑝 ≤ 𝑛 and 1 ≤ 𝑗1 < 𝑗2 < · · · < 𝑗𝑝 ≤ 𝑚, such that 𝑎𝑖1 = 𝑏𝑗1 , . . . , 𝑎𝑖𝑝 = 𝑏𝑗𝑝 .
Input Format. First line: 𝑛. Second line: 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛. Third line: 𝑚. Fourth line: 𝑏1, 𝑏2, . . . , 𝑏𝑚.

Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑛,𝑚 ≤ 100; −109 < 𝑎𝑖, 𝑏𝑖 < 109.

Output Format. Output 𝑝.


Sample 1.
